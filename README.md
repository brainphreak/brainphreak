# brainphreak

Hacker, phreaker, and technologist since 1994. Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering Technology.

## Background

Started on a Commodore 64 in the late '80s, scripted hacking tools using php and cgi scripts using a Sega Saturn Netlink before I had my first linux shell, made games and phreaking tools on my TI-89 calculator in college. I never stop building. I ran the San Diego branch of Phone Losers of America in the late '90s. I spent much of my teen years on the Defcon voice bridge, the PLA and 2600 PBX. Heavy redbox user and used to dial every phone number in every exchange just to see what I would find. Wrote articles for Blacklisted 411, 2600 and other zines. Frequented 2600 meetings in San Diego and attended many hacking converences like schmoocon, toorcon, defcon etc. Been a Hak5 fan since the first WiFi Pineapple dropped. You could say I'm a lifelong phreak.
